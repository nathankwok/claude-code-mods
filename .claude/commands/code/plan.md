# Complete Planning & Building Workflow

Execute the full development planning pipeline for: $ARGUMENTS

## Workflow Execution Instructions

You will execute three sequential phases, with each phase's output feeding into the next:

### Phase 1: Brainstorming Session
1. Invoke the brainstorming-agent with the Task tool for an interactive BMAD-inspired brainstorming session
2. Context: "$ARGUMENTS"
3. Instructions for brainstorming-agent:
   - Initialize session state with project-aware persistence
   - Gather additional context and clarify objectives
   - Recommend and apply appropriate brainstorming techniques
   - Facilitate interactive brainstorming with progressive refinement (0-9)
   - Generate structured outputs and project briefs
   - Save session state to `.claude/state/projects/[project-name]/brainstorming/`
4. Wait for brainstorming completion and note the location of saved project brief

### Phase 2: Technical Architecture Design
1. After brainstorming completes, read the generated project brief from:
   `.claude/state/projects/[project-name]/brainstorming/project-brief-*.json`
2. Invoke the architect-agent with the Task tool
3. Pass the project brief path as input to architect-agent
4. Instructions for architect-agent:
   - Analyze codebase and generate comprehensive architecture documentation
   - Document system components, technology stack, and architectural patterns
   - Generate architecture.md file with current system design
   - Save all architecture artifacts to `.claude/state/projects/[project-name]/architecture/`
5. Wait for architecture completion and note the generated artifacts

### Phase 3: PRD Generation
1. After architecture completes, create a consolidated feature file that includes:
   - Context from brainstorming session outputs
   - Technical architecture from architect outputs
   - Project requirements and constraints
   - All relevant artifacts from previous phases
2. Invoke the generate-prd-agent with the Task tool
3. Pass the consolidated feature information to the agent
4. Instructions for generate-prd-agent:
   - Conduct deep codebase analysis and external research
   - Create phase-based implementation plans with dependency mapping
   - Design multi-agent coordination strategies  
   - Generate comprehensive PRDs optimized for one-pass implementation success
   - Save the PRD as: `prds/{next_highest_integer}_{feature_name}.md`
5. Wait for PRD generation completion and verify the output

## State Management
- Each phase saves its outputs to project-specific state directories
- Subsequent phases read from these state directories
- This ensures continuity and traceability across the workflow

## Expected Outputs
1. **Brainstorming**: Project brief with refined concepts in `.claude/state/projects/[project]/brainstorming/`
2. **Architecture**: Technical specs and documentation in `.claude/state/projects/[project]/architecture/`
3. **PRD**: Comprehensive PRD generated by specialist agent in `prds/{next_highest_integer}_{feature_name}.md`

## Success Criteria
- All three phases complete successfully
- Each phase's output is properly saved and accessible
- Final PRD incorporates insights from all phases
- PRD is ready for `/execute-prd` command
